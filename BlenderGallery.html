Over the years, I seem to have developed a passion for illustrating the intricate world of ultrafast and strong-field light-matter interactions. This page is a compilation of my successes (or failures, depending on your own level of skill...) on this front. I've given special priority to the artwork that is available to the masses (i.e., in papers, talks, etc.), but I certainly cannot (nor would you want me to) include all attempts at making pretty pictures of science. Hopefully, this list with help to give some inspiration and/or foundation for making your own 3D vizualiztaions using Blender!

<p>P.S. The raw .blend files for some (ideally all, but this is work in progress) of these figures can be found here, which you are free to download and use at your leisure (within the licensing retrictions, of course ;)). Although I'm not in the business of making scientific schematics and figures for free, if you have questions about the figures, the .blend files, or the methodology used to create them, feel free to shoot me an email!</p>

    <p>The following artworks were created to support a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6447/eaaw9486.abstract">publication in Science</a> regarding extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light beams possessing a new property of light; self-torque. The links to the individual .blend files (and necessary dependencies) are given below each image.</p>

    <h2>The Generation of Self-Torqued Light Pulses via HHG</h2>
    <img src="/images/SlideShow/LightTorque/LightTorque_Pulses.png" style="width:100%">
    <p>This image is a single frame from an animated cartoon of the generation of self-torqued light pulses via high-harmonic generation (HHG). The blender file utilized to make the animation can be found <a href="/files/Blender Gallery/The Self-Torque of Light/LightTorqueSummary_JILA_v6_Pulses_Animation.blend">here</a>. Note that you will have to run <a href="/files/Blender Gallery/The Self-Torque of Light/20190617_LightTorquePulses_Tube_v1.py.py">the dependent Python script</a> in order to generate the twisted spiral shapes.</p>

    <h2>The Generation of Self-Torqued Light Pulses via HHG (but shown as continuous beam)</h2>
    <img src="/images/SlideShow/LightTorque/LightTorque_NoPulse.png" style="width:100%">
    <p>This image is a single frame from an animated cartoon of the generation of self-torqued light via high-harmonic generation (HHG), except this time we show the self-torqued beam as a continuous spiral. The blender file utilized to make the animation can be found <a href="/files/Blender Gallery/The Self-Torque of Light/LightTorqueSummary_JILA_v6_Pulses_Animation.blend">here</a>.

    <h2>The Generation of Self-Torqued Light Pulses via HHG and Select Properties</h2>
    <img src="/images/SlideShow/LightTorque/LightTorque_Summary.png" style="width:100%">
    <p><b>Generation of EUV beams with self-torque.</b> (A) Two time-delayed, femtosecond infrared (IR) pulses with different OAM are focused into a gas target to produce self-torqued EUV beams through HHG. The unique signature of self-torqued beams is their time-dependent OAM, as shown in (B) for the 17<sup>th</sup> harmonic (47 nm, with self-torque &#958<sub>17</sub>=1.32 fs<sup>-1</sup>). (C) The self-torque imprints an azimuthal frequency chirp, which enables its experimental measurement.</p>
    <p>This figure was utilized as a backdrop for the summary figure appearing in our <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6447/eaaw9486.abstract">Science paper</a> on the self-torque of light.

    <h2>The Generation of Self-Torqued EUV Beams via High-Harmonic Generation</h2>
    <img src="/images/Blender Images/Self Torque/OAMTorque_Science_Figure1.png" style="width:100%">
    <p><b>Generation of EUV beams with self-torque.</b> (A) Two time-delayed, collinear IR pulses with the same wavelength (800 nm), but different OAM values, are focused into an argon gas target (HHG medium) to produce harmonic beams with self-torque. The spatial profile of the complete, time-integrated, HHG beam from full quantum simulations is shown on the EUV CCD. (B) Predicted evolution of the intensity profile of the 17<sup>th</sup> harmonic at three instants in time during the emission process. (C) Temporal evolution of the OAM of the 17<sup>th</sup> harmonic, for two driving pulses with the same duration tau = 10 fs, at a relative time delay of t<sub>d</sub> = tau. The average OAM, ellbar<sup>17</sup> (solid green), and the width of the OAM distribution, sigma<sub>ell 17</sub> (distance between the solid and dashed-green lines), are obtained from Eqs. 2 and 3 of the main text. The self-torque associated with this pulse, &#958<sub>17</sub> = 1.32 fs<sup>−1</sup>, is obtained from the slope of the smooth and continuous time-dependent OAM.</p>

    <h2>Experimental Geometry for the Generation and Detection of Self-Torqued EUV Beams</h2>
    <img src="/images/Blender Images/Self Torque/OAMTorque_Science_Figure3.png" style="width:100%">
    <p><b>Experimental scheme for generating and measuring light beams with a self-torque.</b> (A) Two time-delayed, collinear IR pulses with the same wavelength (790 nm), but different OAM values, are focused into an argon gas target to produce harmonic beams with self-torque. (B) An EUV spectrometer, composed of a cylindrical mirror and flat-grating pair, collapses the HHG beam in the vertical dimension (lab frame y axis), while preserving spatial information, and thus the azimuthal extent in the transverse dimension (lab frame x axis). (Lower-right inset) The cylindrical mirror effectively maps the azimuthal frequency chirp into a spatial chirp along the lab frame x axis (i), which is then dispersed by the grating (ii).</p>

    <h2>Time-Dependent Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Pure, Monodisperse Copper Nanoparticles</h2>
    <img src="/images/SlideShow/Mantis_CuNPs_Delay_w2wPulses.png" style="width:100%">
    <p><b><i>In-situ</i> Pump-Probe Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Ultrafast Thermal Processes in Copper Nanoparticles.</b> A magnetron sputtering source is utilized to produce ligand-free, highly monodisperse copper nanoparticles via the terminated gas condensation method. After a sufficiently long free flight region, liberated copper atoms coalesce into copper nanoparticles, which then pass through a series of differential pumpign apertures that work to collimate the nanoparticle beam. The nanoparticle beam then passes into a velocity map imaging spectrometer, where they are ionized by femtosecond red (790nm) and blue (395nm) laser pulses. The resulting momentum distribution of the ionized electrons is imaged onto an MCP/phosphor screen detector, which is then read by a CCD camera.</p>
