## Allow Me to Introduce... Me

Even the most modest webpages need to have an "About this thing that's on the web" section, and this site is no different. In the following, we'll operate in the third-person prose, but rest assured, this is not how Kevin talks about himself in real life.

Kevin grew up in a small rural community (Enon, OH) just a wee bit south of the center of Ohio, sandwiched somewhere between corn fields, dollar stores, and Tractor Supply Company. During his youth, he spent his days playing in the literal street, running around with friends from the cul-de-sac, and getting into just enough mischief to hold to his biweekly "grounded" schedule. As he progressed through his education, Kevin begun to trade street sports and bonfires for textbooks and science (although not a complete trade). After finishing primary school in his hometown, Kevin enrolled in Wright State University with every intention of going to medical school (and thus winning a $500 bet with his dad, Chuck Dorney).

Luckily for Chuck, Kevin never made the jump to medical school (despite several interviews), and instead found himself increasingly more attracted to the physical side of biology and chemistry. Although he won't say it out loud, Kevin was deeply attracted to the quantum mechanical lectures of his Physical Chemistry professor, David Dolson, and after earning both Biology and Chemistry degrees, he eventually decided to scratch that intellectual itch and enrolled in the Master's program in Chemistry at Wright State under the supervision of Prof. Ioana Pavel.

Although Kevin spent his days performing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy on fun things like [cancer-killing quaterny benzo-phenanthridine alkaloids](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/356634), [sulfur-enhanced Li-ion battery materials](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2973931), and ways to introduce state-of-the-art [nanoscience in secondary education](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed400686u), what he *really* learned during his Master's was a passion for science that he never knew he had.  In particular, Kevin became intimately interested in how specifically controlling, or tailoring, light could enhance our ability to detect and understand nature's intricacies. After finishing his Mater's work, Kevin followed the chemical-physical rabbit hole further down and enrolled in the [PhD program in Chemical Physics](https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/chemical-physics) at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/chemistry/).

Despite being a former biologist, and apparently a former chemist, Kevin continued to dive deeper into the physical version of the rabbit hole and found a home in the [Katpeyn-Murnane group](https://jila.colorado.edu/kmgroup/) in [JILA](https://jila.colorado.edu/) (formerly known as the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics). In-between camping trips, visits to national monuments, parks, and wildernesses (and the occasional triathlon), Kevin engrossed himself in the super-fast, quantum world that collectively gives rise to our observable world and spent his PhD developing some of the most intricate (and also conceptually complex) laser sources in the world. When not dealing with his severe case of [cabin fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_fever), Kevin worked on polarization sculpted, extreme ultraviolet and x-ray lasers, opening new paradigms in polarization how we can make x-ray lasers twist and spin.


### Content is Imortant

  <p>
  In saying that, a one-measure fits-all approach won't do the trick with regards to content promoting. Rather, an emphasis on making remarkable, high caliber and totally genuine content that is engaging, helpful and fascinating for customers will get you the crown.

On social media, we may share our own thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information.
