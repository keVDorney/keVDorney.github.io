<p>Below, you'll find links to some of the various posters that I've made over the past few years (as well as some older ones for funsies). These can be great alternatives to the much longer talks I've given, as poster tend to do a good job of keeping me succinct. A rare feat, for sure.</p>

<!-- Bullet list of poster files, in ascending order.-->
